âœ¦ I have now read all the necessary files. I have a comprehensive understanding of the
  application's functionality, UI, and configuration. I will now proceed to construct the
  final JSON output based on all the information I have gathered.

  Here is a summary of the information I will use to populate the JSON:

   * Product: Name and version from package.json. OS support from package.json build
     configuration. Peripherals from main.js (barcode scanner, printer) and renderer.js
     (thermal printer for invoices, label printer).
   * Installation: Steps are standard for an NSIS installer. Drivers are mentioned in the
     context of troubleshooting and printer setup. Data persistence path from db-path.js and
     main.js.
   * Update: Method from RELEASE_NOTES.md and general knowledge of Electron apps. Data
     preservation is the default behavior.
   * Activation: Flow from main.js and activation.html. Messages from main.js. Offline
     activation is supported. No grace period is mentioned.
   * First Run: Store profile fields from renderer.js and db.js.
   * Data Import: CSV headers from db.js (importProductsFromCSV). Validation rules and common
     errors can be inferred from the same function.
   * Sales: Tabs, workflow, and buttons from renderer.js. Discount and GST logic from
     renderer.js and db.js.
   * Printing: Invoice and label printing details from printer.js, labelTemplate.js, and
     renderer.js.
   * Inventory: Fields and actions from renderer.js and db.js.
   * Reports: GST reports from main.js (generateExcelReport).
   * Settings: Printer settings, barcode regeneration, and paths from renderer.js and main.js.
   * Troubleshooting: Common issues and fixes inferred from the code (e.g., activation issues,
     scanner problems).
   * Support: Information to send for support can be determined from the app's dependencies
     and configuration.

  I will now generate the final JSON.
